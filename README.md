## Papers / articles related to research software

* A Scientist's Nightmare: Software Problem Leads to Five Retractions, Greg Miller, Science, 2006. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.314.5807.1856
  + A comment on this story by crystallographer [Brian Matthews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Matthews_(biochemist)), entitled [Five retracted structure reports: Inverted or incorrect?](http://doi.org/10.1110/ps.072888607), questions the explanation given by the authors of the retracted papers. It is a reminder of the importance of publishing research code. The supposedly faulty code behind this story was never made public.
* Retraction: "Structure of MsbA from E. coli: A homolog of the multidrug resistance ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters", "Structure of the ABC transporter MsbA in complex with ADP·vanadate and lipopolysaccharide", "X-ray structure of the EmrE multidrug transporter in complex with a substrate", Geoffrey Chang, Christopher B. Roth, Christopher L. Reyes, Owen Pornillos, Yen-Ju Chen, and Andy P. Chen, Science, 2006. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.314.5807.1875b
* Retraction: Measures of Clade Confidence Do Not Correlate with Accuracy of Phylogenetic Trees, Barry G Hall, Stephen J Salipante, PLOS Computational Biology, 2007. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030158
* The Effects of FreeSurfer Version, Workstation Type, and Macintosh Operating System Version on Anatomical Volume and Cortical Thickness Measurements, Ed H. B. M. Gronenschild, Petra Habets, Heidi I. L. Jacobs, Ron Mengelers, Nico Rozendaal, Jim van Os, and Machteld Marcelis, PLOS One, 2012. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0038234
* BLOSUM62 miscalculations improve search performance, Mark P Styczynski, Kyle L Jensen, Isidore Rigoutsos, and Gregory Stephanopoulos, Nature Biotechnology, 2008. https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt0308-274
* Retraction: Inferring the Effects of Cancer Treatment: Divergent Results From Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group Meta-Analyses of Randomized Trials and Observational Data From SEER Registries, Katherine E. Henson, Reshma Jagsi, David Cutter, Paul McGale, Carolyn Taylor, and Sarah C. Darby, Journal of Clinical Oncology, 2016. https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2016.69.0875
* Retraction: How birds outperform humans in multi-component behavior, Sara Letzner, Onur Güntürkün, and Christian Beste, Current Biology Magazine, 2017. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2017.07.056
* The war over supercooled water, Ashley G. Smart, Physics Today, 2018, https://doi.org/10.1063/PT.6.1.20180822a
  + This story is announced as a "hidden coding error", but a careful reading shows that it was really a case of an unjustified assumption, which hadn't been written down anywhere else but in the code.
* Characterization of Leptazolines A–D, Polar Oxazolines from the Cyanobacterium Leptolyngbya sp., Reveals a Glitch with the “Willoughby–Hoye” Scripts for Calculating NMR Chemical Shifts, Jayanti Bhandari Neupane, Ram P. Neupane, Yuheng Luo, Wesley Y. Yoshida, Rui Sun, and Philip G. Williams, Organic Letters, 2019. https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.orglett.9b03216
  + Story about this: Researchers find bug in Python script may have affected hundreds of studies, Sean Gallagher, Ars Technicha, 2019. https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/10/chemists-discover-cross-platform-python-scripts-not-so-cross-platform
  + In short, the code in question assumed the list of files in a directory is sorted, which it is on Windows but not on Linux or MacOS (see text describing Figure 2 in Neupane). This is an example of a portability bug.
* Notice of Retraction. Aboumatar et al. Effect of a Program Combining Transitional Care and Long-term Self-management Support on Outcomes of Hospitalized Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: A Randomized Clinical Trial. JAMA. 2018;320(22):2335-2343, Hanan Aboumatar and Robert A. Wise, JAMA. 2019. https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2019.11954
* A case for open communication of bugs in climate models, made with ICON version 2024.01, Proske, U., Brüggemann, N., Gärtner, J. P., Gutjahr, O., Haak, H., Putrasahan, D., and Wieners, K.-H., EGUsphere, 2024.  https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-3493
* _Retracted_: Prediction of posttranslational modification sites from sequences with kernel methods, Xiaobo Wang, Yongcui Wang, Yingjie Tian, Xiaojian Shao, Ling-Yun Wu, and Naiyang Deng, Wiley Periodicals, 2010. https://doi.org/10.1002/jcc.21526
  + "retracted by agreement between the authors, the journal's editors, and Wiley ... because a computational error produced results that led the authors to overstate the level of performance of their computing model."
* Retraction Note: Limited individual attention and online virality of low-quality information by Qiu, Oliveira, Shirazi, Flammini, and Filippo Menczer in _Nature Human Behavior_ in 2019.
  + "a software bug led to an incorrect value"
* Cluster failure: Why fMRI inferences for spatial extent have inflated false-positive rates, Anders Eklunda, Thomas E. Nichols, and Hans Knutssona, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 2016. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1602413113
  + "a 15-year-old bug was found in 3dClustSim while testing the three software packages (the bug was fixed by the AFNI group as of May 2015, during preparation of this manuscript). The bug essentially reduced the size of the image searched for clusters, underestimating the severity of the multiplicity correction and overestimating significance"

## Papers / articles related to general software as used in research (eg, Excel-related errors)

* Mistaken identifiers: gene name errors can be introduced inadvertently when using Excel in bioinformatics, Zeeberg BR, Riss J, Kane DW, Bussey KJ, Uchio E, Linehan WM, Barrett JC, and Weinstein JN, BMC Bioinformatics. 2004. https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-5-80
* Does high public debt consistently stifle economic growth? A critique of Reinhart and Rogoff, Thomas Herndon, Michael Ash and Robert Pollin, Cambridge Journal of Economics, 2014, https://doi.org/10.1093/cje/bet075
* Gene name errors are widespread in the scientific literature, Ziemann M, Eren Y, and El-Osta A, Genome Biololgy, 2016. https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-016-1044-7
* Covid: how Excel may have caused loss of 16,000 test results in England, Alex Hern, The Guardian, 2020. https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/05/how-excel-may-have-caused-loss-of-16000-covid-tests-in-england
* Guidelines for human gene nomenclature, Elspeth A. Bruford, Bryony Braschi, Paul Denny, Tamsin E. M. Jones, Ruth L. Seal, and Susan Tweedie, Nature Genetics, 2020. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-020-0669-3
  + includes "symbols that affect data handling and retrieval, e.g. all symbols that auto-converted to dates in Microsoft Excel have been changed (SEPT1 is now SEPTIN1; MARCH1 is now MARCHF1 etc); tRNA synthetase symbols that were also common words have been changed (WARS is now WARS1, CARS is now CARS1, etc.)."
* Microsoft Finally Fixes Excel Glitch That Caused Major Headaches for Scientists, Josh Hendrickson, PC Mag, 2023. https://www.pcmag.com/news/microsoft-finally-fixes-excel-glitch-that-caused-major-headaches-for-scientists
  + includes "Years after introducing Excel's automatic conversion features, Microsoft rolls out an update to prevent it from changing gene symbols to dates." 
*  Does high public debt consistently stifle economic growth? A critique of Reinhart and Rogoff by Thomas Herndon, Michael Ash, and Robert Pollin in _Cambridge Journal of Economics_ on 2013 Dec 24. <https://doi.org/10.1093/cje/bet075>
  + > In their analysis with the 1946–2009 dataset, RR [Reinhart and Rogoff] calculated both means and medians of cells in lines 30–44 instead of lines 30–49. In their analysis with the 1790–2009 dataset, RR calculated both means and medians for cells in lines 5–19 instead of lines 5–24. As such, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada and Denmark were excluded entirely from their calculations with both the 1946–2009 and 1790–2009 data samples.
  + Reinhart and Rogoff acknowledge the error in a NYTimes column, while maintaining the validity of their conclusion. <https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/04/17/business/17economix-response.html>
    + > On the first point, we reiterate that Herndon, Ash and Pollin accurately point out the coding error that omits several countries from the averages in figure 2. Full stop. HAP are on point. Theauthors show our accidental omission has a fairly marginal effect on the 0-90% buckets in figure2. However, it leads to a notable change in the average growth rate for the over 90% debt group.The median growth rate we report is the right order of magnitude.
  + The paper in question (Growth in a Time of Debt by Reinhart and Rogoff, as an NBER working paper, last revised in 2011 Dec <https://doi.org/10.3386/w15639>) was cited by politicians as motivation for public policy changes by American, EU, and British politicians, so this error may have had an outsized impact.
* A journey of reproducibility from Excel to Pandas, Simon Hettrick, Software Sustainability Institute's blog, 2017. https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/journey-reproducibility-excel-pandas
  + > Everything looks rosy until you get to question 9... This mistake occurred because I was using a SEARCH() function to differentiate between possible answers. I had searched for "taught", which is not unique across the potential answers, rather than "a taught" which is. Here lies one of the biggest problems with Excel: a mistake can throw out a tiny part of the overall analysis, which is hard to detect. By contrast, programming forces you to abstract your analysis so that it can be applied more generally, and this means that mistakes generally have wide-ranging effects, which makes them easier to detect.
  + > Even something as simple as listing the steps in the original analysis became invaluable when trying to fathom the logic in the original spreadsheet. On that front, I can conclusively say that whilst it’s not impossible to reconstruct the logic behind "40 columns of arcane transformations", it is so, so much simpler to review a couple of lines of well-commented code.
